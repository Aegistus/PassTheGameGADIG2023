I don't want to give a ton of notes, as the whole point of the challenge
is "no communication" but I just wanted to say a few things that I think
are OK ish:

1. This game is kind of an MVP as I'm handing it off. It is playable
from start to finish with 4 levels. So in case that leaves a feeling
that, like, anything here is set in stone: it isn't. Feel free to
throw away anything; all 4 levels; any mechanics you don't like, etc.

If you totally dislike the levels system you may even want to tear out
a lot of the code I wrote; e.g. things like GameManager, MainMenu,
WinScreen are all sort of tied into the current gameplay that I designed.

2. My project layout may be a little less traditional, so I wanted to
briefly explain it.

Basically, each separate thing gets its own folder. So the Player gets
a folder with Player-related things. The Tiles folder contains tiles.
The Objects folder contains things that seem like objects, like a
crate or whatever.

Then, if an object has a lot of other files associated with it, like
animations, etc, it gets its own folder *inside* the objects folder.

I would usually also put, like, the Player script inside the Player folder,
but so far all the scripts have ended up just in Assets... and all
the scenes have ended up under Scenes.

This may be a little messy. Sorry. The good news is you could technically
reorganize everything if you want. There's not that many different
sprites/scripts/scenes/prefabs.

3. I have commented some of the code. My goal is largely to comment this
as though I was working on my own game, so hopefully it doesn't feel
rule-breaking.

I am inexperienced in Unity so some of the comments are for my own good
in that way.
